PRIORITIZED TODO LIST

* sponsor donation: allow for donation from non registered users;

* corporate registration: register n people from same company in one shot.

UNPRIORITIZED TODO LIST

* add a can_purchase_registration() method to Act::User

* change password barfs on non ASCII characters

* main act.ini should be renamed to avoid confusion with conferences act.ini

* schedule columns should be fixed width

* replace login with email address
  the display name would be nick_name, pseudonymous would be the default behavior

* display a nicer page for expired twostep urls, instead of 404 (rjbs)

* let the organizers force the registration of existing users
  (useful for speakers who can't be bothered to use the site,
  but will give a talk)

* the payments page should let the one create a new user, register it
  and add a payment (and use the code for finding duplicate users)
  (useful for on site registration during the conference)

* define a set of coherent CSS styles for the application templates,
  so that conference organizers may easily override the application
  look and feel, and integrate it into their web site

* attendees: if a registered user doesn't show up, how is s/he counted?
  should there be a way for the organisers to mark the attendees as
  present? When a conference is over, treasurer/orga should be able to
  unregister participants who didn't show up.

* some statistics for the organizers
  - T-shirts stats:
    select count(*), tshirt_size from participations where conf_id=? group by tshirt_size;
  - family stats:
    select sum(nb_family) from participations where conf_id=?

* remove duplicate users from the database. this is an administrative task 
  which requires contacting users and asking which of their many logins
  to keep

* most tables should be sortable by clicking on column headers.
  => by default, sort the user search results by registration date, not
     by user_id

* more tests, especially for the web interface

* may a user have a different photograph every year?

* global user stats (top attendee, top speaker, etc)

* user-configurable searchlimit

* support for several monger groups (addition, search)

* PDF immutable invoices

* create a eg/ directory with at least two example conferences

* support for per conference options, like
  - register the hotel (e.g. european hackathon 2007)
  - vegetarian food

* hackathons do not have talks. Support that by disabling the talks
  related handlers.

* handle the edition of lightning talk sessions, by creating something
  less burdensome than the current talk:id 

* shouldn't the tshirt size at user creation not be shown when the
  conference doesn't include a T-shirt?

* should the tshirt size be 'per conference'? (but copied from the
  info stored in the users base)

* Special Needs Support in a Flexible Way
  Registration should be able to accept information for many different things
  like the need of special meals, t-shirts size, special needs for
  accommodation and the like.  Registration for a specific event shouldn't
  include information which is irrelevant to that event.

* Optional SSL Protected Admin Login
  There should be an optional SSL protected login option, at least for admins,
  allowing them to login to the website without being evasedropped.

* RSS feed for the wiki
